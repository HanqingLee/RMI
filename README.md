# Basic RMI Implementation

This project aims to build the basic implementation of a RMI system. Through which you can do the basic implementations 
\of remote procedure call as the java rmi can provide.

### Prerequisites

Implementing of this RMI system itself does not need any more request except the Java environment. But there is a testing example in this project, which needs the accessing of MySQL service. You need first initiate a database in server, pass the database name, user name and password to the RMIPracticeImpl's constructor to instantiate the connection.

### Running the tests

To start up testing, operate the test.server file. Then operate the Client file, or ConcurrentClient file to start the test.
